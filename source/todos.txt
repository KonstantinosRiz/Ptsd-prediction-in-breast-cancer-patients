Preprocessing comments:

	1. Eliminate samples with no label: 
		straighforward
	2. Eliminate features with too many missing values:
		keep features with maximum 25% missing values -> not much sense in playing around with this
	3. Eliminate samples with too many missing values
		keep samples with less than 90 missing values -> 50 is also sensible based on the histogram but shouldn't really change much either, also don't want to
								 throw away a lot of samples
	4. Split the dataset into train/test
		train/test partition but it's pretty standard
	5. Impute missing values
		number of imputed datasets doesn't seem that important
	6.1. Eliminate features with near zero variance
		freqCut = 95/5 default, maybe worth checking out
	6.2. Eliminate highly correlated features
		correlation_method = spearman, check it out but not that important
		correlation_threshold = 0.8 play around a bit

TODOs:
	Talked about with gestam:
		1. visualize results (eg barplots)	-->	DONE
		2. split train-test based on hospitals	-->	DONE
		3. explainable ai plots
		4. discuss contents of diploma
		5. research hyper-parameters of config on the internet	-->	DONE


	Review models and run the results for all the imputed datasets: gather and average results	-->	DONE
	Run for all labels (months)



	Many runs that check the randomness:
		maybe save the results (in some form?) at the disk and then load them all together and average them	-->	Νο need, that's what repeared cv is for







Later:
	3. Performance report
